# Roguelike API


## Swagger Documentation
When writing API Endpoints please add Swagger documentation to the endpoints to
specify required parameters and expected responses.
You can find more information about Swagger [here](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/blob/master/docs/Getting-started.md).

Once you have added documentation to a controller endpoint you can regenerate
the `/api/documentation` view with the following command:
+ `php artisan swagger-lume:generate`

Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
